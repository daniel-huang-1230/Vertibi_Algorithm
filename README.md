# Viterbi_Algorithm
CSE150-Introduction to Artificial Intelligence and Search

Consider a discrete HMM with n = 27 hidden states St∈ {1, 2, . . . , 27} and binary observations Ot∈ {0, 1}. The .txt files included contain parameter values for the initial state distribution πi = P(S1 = i), the transition matrix aij = P(St+1 = j|St = i), and the emission matrix bik = P(Ot =k|St =i), as well as a long bit sequence of T = 180000 observations.
Use the Viterbi algorithm to compute the most probable sequence of hidden states conditioned on this
particular sequence of observations.
